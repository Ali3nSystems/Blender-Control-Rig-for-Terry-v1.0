# Blender Control Rig for Terry v1.0

Use only with the latest version of Blender.

Please read this [page](https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Citizen_Model) in order to understand better how the citizen.fbx works.

This control rig drives the already existing skeleton from the citizen.fbx file supplied by [Facepunch](https://facepunch.com), meaning that it doesn't use a different skeleton and however the animation may be displayed in Blender, it will be displayed with the same accuracy in S&box (that is once the twist and helper bones are configured in Blender).
