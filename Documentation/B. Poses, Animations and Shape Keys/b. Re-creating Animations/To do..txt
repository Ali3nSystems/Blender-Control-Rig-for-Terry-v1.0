At this very moment I won't be explaining how to re-create existing animations from the citizen animation folder, main reason is because this package is still in its early stages and subject to change. 
The tutorial on how to re-create animations is very lenghty and I won't be wasting my time if I find another better way. For now you don't have any animations available.
The reason we are re-creating is because we can't import them as they are.
